Hi! My name is Rafael, I'm from Brazil and I'm currently a student. 👨‍💻

I'm always looking to learn and improve my skills.

<b>About me 😄</b>

<li>I was born and live in Marília, São Paulo 👶</li>
<li>Besides programming, I also love staying with my family and gaming in my free time 🎮</li>
<li>Always listening to some music and read books 🎶</li>
<li>Each passing day, I'm more in love about front-end development and JS 💘</li>
<li>Open to an opportunity to gain experience and practice my skills 😅</li>
